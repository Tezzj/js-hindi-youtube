        In a method (a function inside an object or class), this refers to the object that the method is a property of.
        
        In a regular function (outside of an object or class), this can be undefined in strict mode or refer to the global object (like window in browsers).
        
        Inside a constructor function or class, this refers to the newly created object (instance).
        
        
        The bind(this) part is crucial: it binds the this value inside the handleClick method to the current instance of the React class.
        Without bind, this inside handleClick would refer to the button element when the event handler is called, not the class instance.

            console.log("button clicked");
            console.log(this.server);
        }
    }
