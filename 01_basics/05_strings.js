/*+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++IMPORTANT POINT+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In JavaScript, strings are immutable, meaning that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. This is true whether you use a primitive string or
a String object.
The immutability of strings in JavaScript means that operations on strings always produce new strings rather than modifying existing ones.
